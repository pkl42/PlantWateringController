# Tasmota Rules for Moisture Sensor

This rule control the ESP8266 moisture sensor behavior, MQTT reporting, and deep sleep cycle.  
The power for the sensor is controlled by output pin

**Explanation**

| Variable       | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Var1`         | Stores latest ADC (moisture) value                           |
| `Var3`         | Countdown until deep sleep                                   |
| `Mem1`, `Mem2` | Optional calibration memory values, currently decomissioned  |
| `Mem3`         | DeepSleepTime in seconds (set via MQTT)                      |
| `TelePeriod`   | Telemetry interval                                           |
| `Power1`       | Turns sensor supply pin ON                                   |
| `RuleTimer1`   | Timer controlling when moisture data is sent                 |

**MQTT Command to Set Sleep Time**

cmnd/<device_topic>/Mem3 <seconds>

~~~text
cmnd/MS_594908/Mem3 600
~~~

â†’ Sleeps for 10 minutes after sending next telemetry packet.  
When device returns from Deepsleep, the DeepSleepTime is set to 0. Otherwise there would be no chance  
to switch off the deep sleep mode by mqtt message. Vice versa to fall in deep sleep again the
cmnd/<device_topic>/Mem3-topic should be retained message.

Debug Output (Example)

~~~text
stat/<device_topic>/debug Restart_Timer1
stat/<device_topic>/debug Going_to_sleep

stat/MS_594908/debug Restart_Timer1
stat/MS_594908/debug Going_to_sleep
~~~

These messages are useful for monitoring device behavior in Node-RED or the MQTT broker.

### Experiences and Issues

During developing the rule i tried to do the conversion into percentage value within the rule,  
but for some reason the calculated value delayed significant from raw value.
